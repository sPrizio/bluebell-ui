### SCSS Notes
Styles for this app are implemented using SCSS modules suffixed with .module.scss.
Theming is handled via 3 files:
- colors.module.scss
- typography.module.scss
- variables.module.scss

In addition, due to some programming limitiations, any theme changes must be
manually added to the following files:
- bluebell-datepicker.css
- constants.CssConstants.ts
